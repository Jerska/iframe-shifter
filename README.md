# Iframe Shifter

Grow the body of a page and shift it vertically to hide a header.

## Usage

Load this website with two query parameters:
- `url`: the URL to load in an iframe
- `height`: the size to add to the body and to move it vertically

Example: https://jerska.github.io/iframe-shifter/?height=100px&url=https%3A%2F%2Fyour-website-here.com%2F

This only works for websites allowing cross-origin framing.
